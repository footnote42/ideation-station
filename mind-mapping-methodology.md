1. Core Principles of Buzan-Style Mind Mapping
1.1 Central Image / Central Idea

Rule

Every mind map begins with a single central concept, ideally represented as an image rather than text.

This sits physically at the centre of the page or canvas.

Why it matters cognitively

The brain processes images faster and more holistically than words.

A central image acts as a cognitive anchor, activating associative thinking in multiple directions rather than linear recall.

It mirrors how memory is organised: around focal concepts, not lists.

Design implication

The central node is not just a root—it is the visual gravity well of the map.

1.2 Radiant Structure (Radial Thinking)

Rule

Ideas radiate outward from the centre in all directions.

Major themes form primary branches; details form sub-branches.

Why it matters

Radiant structure aligns with associative neural firing, where ideas trigger related ideas non-linearly.

Encourages expansion rather than premature categorisation.

Reduces the cognitive friction imposed by top-down or left-to-right structures.

Design implication

The system must privilege radial expansion over vertical or hierarchical layouts.

1.3 Keywords, Not Sentences

Rule

Each branch contains one keyword only, not phrases or sentences.

Why it matters

Single words act as mental triggers, allowing the brain to supply meaning dynamically.

Phrases lock thinking into fixed interpretations and reduce creative recombination.

Keywords increase branching density without visual overload.

Design implication

The system should gently discourage paragraph-like nodes without forbidding flexibility.

1.4 Colour, Imagery, Symbols

Rule

Use multiple colours, icons, images, and symbols liberally and meaningfully.

Colour is used to differentiate branches, themes, or emotional tone.

Why it matters

Colour and imagery activate right-hemisphere processing, improving recall and engagement.

Visual variation prevents habituation and keeps attention high.

Symbolic compression allows complex ideas to be grasped at a glance.

Design implication

Visual expressiveness is not decoration—it is functional cognition support.

1.5 Hierarchy and Associations

Rule

Clear parent–child relationships exist along branches.

Cross-links between branches are encouraged where ideas relate.

Why it matters

Hierarchy supports chunking, reducing cognitive load.

Cross-links enable insight moments, where disparate ideas combine.

This dual structure reflects both structured memory and creative leaps.

Design implication

The system must support both hierarchy and lateral association without friction.

2. Structural Model (Conceptual Components)
2.1 Core Elements

Central Node

Single focal concept, visually distinct.

Primary Branches

Major themes or dimensions.

Sub-Branches

Increasing specificity as distance from centre increases.

Associative Links (Cross-links)

Non-hierarchical connections between nodes.

2.2 Relationships

Parent–Child

Defines conceptual refinement.

Sibling

Represents parallel ideas.

Associative

Represents conceptual resonance, analogy, or reuse.

2.3 Essential vs Flexible Rules

Essential (Non-negotiable for fidelity)

Single central idea

Radial expansion

Keyword-based nodes

Visual differentiation

Free association

Flexible (Context-dependent)

Exact branch curvature

Degree of colour usage

Use of images vs symbols

Strict enforcement of “one word only”

3. Creative Ideation Focus
3.1 Divergent Thinking

Mind maps excel at:

Rapid idea generation

Avoiding early filtering

Encouraging “what else?” thinking

They delay judgement, allowing quantity before quality.

3.2 Idea Expansion & Recombination

Each keyword invites multiple interpretations.

Cross-links allow ideas to recombine into new concepts.

Spatial proximity fosters emergent patterns.

This is especially valuable in vibe coding, where direction evolves through exploration.

3.3 Non-Linear Exploration

Users can jump between branches without losing context.

No “correct order” exists.

The map grows organically based on attention and curiosity.

Critical distinction

Mind maps are for thinking, not tracking.

Once execution begins, other tools take over.

4. Digital Translation Considerations
4.1 Free-Form Layout vs Constraints

Faithful approach

Prioritise freedom of placement and growth.

Avoid auto-alignment that forces linearity.

Risk

Over-structuring turns mind maps into disguised outlines.

4.2 Visual Emphasis & Spatial Memory

Spatial positioning must be meaningful and persistent.

Users remember where ideas are, not just what they are.

Implication

Aggressive auto-layout or collapsing destroys spatial memory.

4.3 Speed of Capture vs Polish

Capture must be faster than conscious filtering.

Visual refinement should be optional and deferrable.

Golden rule

If it takes longer to add an idea than to think it, the tool breaks the method.

4.4 Common Digital Mistakes

Treating nodes like text boxes

Encouraging sentences and notes

Forcing vertical trees

Prioritising export formats over thinking flow

Turning mind maps into project plans

These drift away from Buzan’s intent and suppress creativity.

5. High-Level Design Requirements
5.1 Functional Requirements

Central-node-first creation

Radial, multi-directional expansion

Fast keyword entry

Effortless branch creation and deletion

Cross-linking between any nodes

Optional imagery and symbol attachment

Persistent spatial layout

5.2 Experiential Requirements

Feels playful, not administrative

Encourages exploration over completion

Rewards visual diversity

Minimises friction during ideation

Supports ambiguity and partial ideas

5.3 Philosophical Alignment

Tool acts as a thinking amplifier, not a manager

Structure emerges from use, not enforcement

Creativity is prioritised over tidiness

The map is a living cognitive landscape, not a document
